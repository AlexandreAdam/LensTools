LensTools tests
================

To test the package on your machine you will need to install the python module test package (pytest); just type in a shell

    pip install pytest

After that you can run the tests, just type in a shell

    py.test

This will test if the code runs and if everything succeeds a bunch of png figures will appear. Good luck!

Weak Lensing analysis tools
======

This python package collects together a suite of widely used analysis tools in Weak Gravitational Lensing: **WARNING!** This is in active stage of development! These features are currently implemented (but not tested):

1. Limber integrals for convergence power spectrum calculations
2. Image analysis tools: gradients and peak counts

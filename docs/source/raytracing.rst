Ray tracing simulations
***********************

.. warning:: This part of LensTools is in its beginning stage, and it is far from stable; it is under active development now! Use with care!

Provides a ray tracing engine to build your own set of simulated shear and convergence maps, documentation under construction... For more info look at :doc:`code`

This is the capability of the tracer right now, here's how a :math:`512\times 512` convergence and shear map triplet looks like (the lenses were highly correlated cause they were drawn from the same slice evolved in redshift, so don't take it too seriously)

For a more hands-on demo of the current capabilities of the ray tracer, please look at this `notebook <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/apetri/Notebooks/blob/master/gravitational_lensing.ipynb>`_
